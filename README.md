Documentation and downloads are available here: https://docs.dangl-it.com/Projects/Dangl.OpenCDE

## CI/CD

The `Jenkinsfile` is only executed for the repository at [GeorgDangl/Dangl.OpenCDE](https://github.com/GeorgDangl/Dangl.OpenCDE), to have deployments controlled by a separate repository.

The pipeline in GitHub Actions does currently not correctly execute, since this repository is referencing some internal packages that are not yet made available publicly.
